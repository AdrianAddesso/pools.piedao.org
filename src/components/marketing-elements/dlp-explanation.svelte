        Blue chips only. DEFI+L represents DeFi’s biggest and best. Like all our pies DEFI+L actively rebalances, constantly locking in profits as market prices fluctuate.

        With DEFI+L we wanted to give users easy exposure to the biggest DeFi projects at the top of their game. Although there are never guarantees in this industry these projects represent the most established, respected and valued assets in the space.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Methodology:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        Our community came to consensus that these projects are the clear leaders in DeFi. Whether the metric is marketcap, volume, assets under management or recognition, these projects lead the pack.
        <br/><br/>
        Allocation is determined using a strict methodology, with percentage share proportional to the market cap of each project weighted through the computation of a Sentiment Score assessing each project’s innovation, functionality to the DeFi ecosystem & growth potential. This robust procedure allows our pies to scale to the largest possible size, without smaller projects with less liquidity limiting potential growth.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Operation:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        DEFI+L is a tokenized representation of the seven biggest projects in DeFi. When a user mints DEFI+L our contract either purchases the underlying assets from Uniswap and other decentralized providers or uses tokens available in the user’s wallet, sending them to our treasury. In this way DEFI+L tokens are fully backed by reserves, redeemable at any time at the press of a button.
        <br/><br/>
        The index is built using Balancer smart pools which constantly rebalance and react to market changes in real-time. There is no withdrawal fee, and a highly competitive 0.7% streaming fee rewards DOUGH holders for their governance of the system.
        <br/><br/>
        It’s also possible to stake DEFI+L in our DEFI+L / ETH pool. Users are able to provide liquidity in return for a steady stream of DOUGH. This pool enables an efficient market for other users to easily swap in and out of the DEFI+L token.
